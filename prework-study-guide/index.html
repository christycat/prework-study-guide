        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation.</li>
          <li>HTML allwos the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.</li>
          <li>A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.</li>
          <li>The three main parts of an element are: Opening tag, Content, Closing tag.</li>
          <li>Opening tag-used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with an opening and closing angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Content-this is the output that other users see.</li>        
          <li>Closing tag-the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
          <li>CSS is used to set the style in web pages that contain HTML elements. It sets background color, font-size, font-family color, etc.</li>
          <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are stored in external .css files</li>
          <li>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management.</li>
          <li>Git is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.</li>
          <li>Git is used to track changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development</li>
          <li>Git workflow-divided into three states: Working directory, Staging area (index), Git directory (Repository)</li>
          <li>Working directory - Modify files in your working directory</li>
          <li>Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area</li>
          <li>Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your Git directory. Checkout any exising version, make changes, stage them and commit</li>
          <li>Branch in Git is used to keep your changes until they are ready. You can do your work on a branch while the main branch remains stable.</li>
          <li>After you are finished with your work, you can merge it with the main branch</li>
          <li>git status:  checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name:  creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and the server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive</li>
          <li>Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user</li>
